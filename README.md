# POCOR_PATH_FOLLOWING_OBSTACLE_AVOIDING_CAMERA_FEATURED_OBJECT_CARRYING_ROBOT
This project entails the development of a robotic system based on the ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) framework, incorporating simulation in Gazebo. The robot is programmed to execute various tasks, such as path tracking, obstacle avoidance (utilizing Nav2), object manipulation, and incorporates a camera functionality.
